## Steam Whistle
Steam Whistle is a web application for facilitating easy transmission of encrypted messages.
Communicating securely and discretely has never been more important.  Whether you
are sharing information with your doctor, lawyer, friend Steam Whistle aims to 
make the process intuitave and easy.

If you are a journalist or a whistle-blower, please consider being a Steam Whistle Blower.

### Technology
Steam whistle uses the [keybase.io](https://keybase.io) API (and kbpgp npm package) including
* User Authentication
* User Lookup
* Message Encryption / Decryption

Encrypted messages are stored in their encrypted state, requiring a users passphrase to decrypt.
At no point does Steam Whistle store your passphrase.

### Project Information
Steam Whistle is built on the MEAN stack, leveraging javascript on both the front and backends.

Steam Whistle follows [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/)
> a simple set of rules and requirements that dictate how version numbers are assigned and incremented. These rules are based on but not necessarily limited to pre-existing widespread common practices in use in both closed and open-source software.

Steam Whistle follows the [git flow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) branching model.
